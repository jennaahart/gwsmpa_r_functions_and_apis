# Load the datasets

```{r}

counties_demographics <- readRDS(here("data", "counties_demographics.rds"))
counties_elexresults <- readRDS(here("data", "counties_elexresults.rds"))
counties_rural_urban_suburban <- readRDS(here("data", "counties_rural_urban_suburban.rds"))



```

# Exercises

Join together the election results and urban/suburban/rural tables above, and then use the merged table to:

-   filter for just Virginia

-   group/summarize to calculate the mean pct of Trump 2020 vote by urban/rural categories

```{r}

results_urban_suburban_rural <- counties_elexresults%>%
  inner_join(counties_rural_urban_suburban)


```

```{r}


results_urban_suburban_rural%>%
  filter(state_code == "VA")%>%
  group_by(rural_urban)%>%
  summarise(mean_trump = mean(pct_r_2020))

 



```

Now using the joined dataset, come up with two groupings you find interesting or newsworthy in a particular state, and replicate the steps above them them instead.

(i.e. instead of for urban/rural, perhaps you want to look at pct of white college grads in Michigan, etc. If you're having trouble, you can stick with Virginia as your state.)

```{r}


results_urban_suburban_rural%>%
  filter(state_code == "VA")%>%
  group_by(rural_urban)%>%
  summarise(mean_trump = mean(pct_r_2016))


```


```{r}


results_urban_suburban_rural%>%
  filter(state_code == "VA")%>%
  group_by(rural_urban)%>%
  summarise(mean_marigin = mean(margin))


```
